Facebook Exporter Contact Exporter
==================================

Forked from http://code.google.com/p/fb-exporter/

Your friends on Facebook made their information public to you, such as their email, phonenumber, and websites. They want you to know about them! But there is no way to extract such date and place it in your most used contact book so you can keep in touch with them.

This extension will allow you to get their contact information in case you would like to contact them with your favorite email client. You can extract their information and transfer it to your client.  

Your not stealing their information, your friends are making it public for you to use them.


Extra functionality?
-------------------
This extension will extract their phone numbers too! So you can sync them into your contact book as well. Great to place in your mobile phone or call them directly from online phone.

Have fun!
